Play the adventure game Zork

## About 
Zork is one of the classic text based adventure games from an era before high-end graphics circuits, instead it runs on the graphics hardware of your mind!

Explore the white house, the forest surrounding it and the hidden kingdom below it. Moving this from the text domain to the voice domain makes for a curiously engaging experience and if nothing else a fun couple of minutes.

The skill utilizes the excellent Frotz (http://frotz.sourceforge.net/) Z-Machine interpreter and the Zork data files are from infocom-if (http://infocom-if.org/index2.html).

*Be ware of Grues....*
